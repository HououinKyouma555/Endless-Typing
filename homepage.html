        <h3 id="About-us">About Endless Typing</h3>

        <p>The University of Illinois Springfield defines writer’s block as: “the inability to begin or continue writing for reasons other than a lack of basic skill and commitment.". 
            Writer’s block often arises when an inability to produce a good first sentence meets a desire to write something good. However, oftentimes your first writing 
            is ugly and cloudy, pouring like clear water only after draining the impurities floating at the top of your brain. After all, writing is a form of thinking itself, 
            and it’s only after some initial writing has been done that you might have a clear idea of what exactly you want to convey. Science fiction writer and bestseller Isaac Asimov said that, 
            “writing, to me, is simply thinking through my fingers.” According to MIT, brainstorming is best done by writing anything you can think of, “no matter how crazy it may initially seem."
            Thus, the inability to begin writing inhibits brainstorming that facilitates more writing, creating a productivity death cycle. The purpose of Endless Typing is to 
            surmount this first hurdle by incentivizing continual writing by creating a commitment app that keeps writers writing. This will be achieved through two functions in Endless Typing: 
            Write Mode and Think mode. Write mode will prompt the user for a length of time they’d like to write, and then take them to a blank screen. Once the user starts writing, they can’t 
            stop typing until the desired time has passed. If users stop typing for too long, Endless Typing will delete everything you’ve written. By presenting a negative incentive, this will 
            hopefully encourage the user to push through until they’ve reached a point of clear understanding and writing. Once this is done, Think Mode will ensue, suggesting grammatical and 
            conceptual changes with an AI function similar to ChatGPT or Notion AI. This would be achieved through GPT-3.5 Turbo’s plugin feature, allowing Endless Typing to access the capabilities 
            of GPT-3.5 Turbo. Users will also be able to explore new ideas by asking the Endless Typing AI for brainstorming suggestions. Endless Typing won’t do the thinking for the user––it 
            will only provide the direction. By toggling between these two modes, Endless Typing hopes to facilitate good thinking through writing.</p>

            <p>Think Mode is still in development.</p>
